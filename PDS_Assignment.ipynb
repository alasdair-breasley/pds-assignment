    "**Design:**\n",
    "The script begins by scraping the website main page for the URL to the initial publications page, checking for links containing \"publicationfull_type_\". It is assumed \"publicationfull_type_\" will be in the initial publications page URL in the future. This is more robust than starting from a specific topic URL as the topic category names in the publications page could change causing a hardcoded URL to fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script then scrapes the initial publications page for the relative URLs to every publications topic page, checking for links containing \"publicationfull_type_\". \"publicationfull_type_\" is unique to topic page URLs and it is assumed this will be the case in the future. This is more robust than using a hardcoded list of topic page URLs as it deals with the case where topic categories are added or changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script then combines the main_page_url with each relative topic page URL and scrapes each of the topic pages, checking for div tags with class \"w3-cell-row\". The \"w3-cell-row\" class is unique to the publication elements required to be scraped, it is assumed this will be the case in the future. It is assumed that the combined topic pages are exhaustive and any additional future publications will be either assigned to a current, new or altered topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The publication title, year and author list are extracted from each publication element. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is then processed and presented as specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "As little as possible is hardcoded e.g. the main_page_url is defined in the first chunk and then all relative urls are concatinated with the main_page_url when required later in the script. This makes the code more robust only requiring the main_page_url to be updated in the first chunk if it changes in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Checks are implemented throughout the script to ensure the correct data type, length of lists, etc. are returned from each stage, with error messages printed if not. This improves robustness and informs the user if the script is malfuncitoning in some way which might not be immediately obvious. \n",
    "\n",
    "Find all is used as opposed to find to allow for checks on the number of items returned in the list from find all, checking if the tag has not been found at all or if it has been found more times than expected. "
