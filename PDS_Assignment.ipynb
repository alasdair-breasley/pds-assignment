    "\n",
    "**Design:**\n",
    "The script begins by scraping the website main page for the URL to the initial publications page, checking for links containing \"publicationfull_type_\". It is assumed \"publicationfull_type_\" will be in the initial publications page URL in the future. This is more robust than starting from a specific topic URL as the topic category names in the publications page could change causing a hardcoded URL to fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script then scrapes the initial publications page for the relative URLs to every publications topic page, checking for links containing \"publicationfull_type_\". \"publicationfull_type_\" is unique to topic page URLs and it is assumed this will be the case in the future. This is more robust than using a hardcoded list of topic page URLs as it deals with the case where topic categories are added or changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script then combines the main_page_url with each relative topic page URL and scrapes each of the topic pages, checking for div tags with class \"w3-cell-row\". The \"w3-cell-row\" class is unique to the publication elements required to be scraped, it is assumed this will be the case in the future. It is assumed that the combined topic pages are exhaustive and any additional future publications will be either assigned to a current, new or altered topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The publication title, year and author list are extracted from each publication element. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is then processed and presented as specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "As little as possible is hardcoded e.g. the main_page_url is defined in the first chunk and then all relative urls are concatinated with the main_page_url when required later in the script. This makes the code more robust only requiring the main_page_url to be updated in the first chunk if it changes in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Checks are implemented throughout the script to ensure the correct data type, length of lists, etc. are returned from each stage, with error messages printed if not. This improves robustness and informs the user if the script is malfuncitoning in some way which might not be immediately obvious. \n",
    "\n",
    "Find all is used as opposed to find to allow for checks on the number of items returned in the list from find all, checking if the tag has not been found at all or if it has been found more times than expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using soup as the variable for each scraped page to continually overwrite as opposed to use more memory. "

    "**Design:**\n",
    "It was decided that, although it is possible to fully combine the scripts for Questions 1 and 2 and have slightly less scraping traffic for the website, that for the purposes of this exercise a clear distinction between questions would ease interpretability for marking. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script begins by using the URL for the initial publications page scraped in question 1. This page is then scraped to get a list of topics, locating tags by searching for links containing \"publicationfull_type_\" and collecting the topic text. This strategy, while effective for Question 1, doesn't yield the first topic due to the current topic page you're on not having a link in the topics section. regex was used to locate the current page's topic and add as the first topic list item. \n",
    "\n",
    "publication_page_urls was used from Question 1 to loop through and scrape each topic page. An initial check is implemented for if the topic page contains a Journal Papers section, with topic pages not containing skippped. Each tag corresponding to individual journal papers is then scraped from the topic page. These journal paper elements are then looped through, with publication title and year collected and the corresponding publication topic taken from the topics list. The relative URL for each of the individual journal paper pages is taken and combined with the main_page_url. Each individual journal paper page is then scraped to collect the number of citations: using regex, and the number of LDORs: calculated as the number of LDOR links present and the number of YouTube videos embeded, ensuring not to double count the dynamic thumbnail image links. Both citations and LDORs are given values of 0 if the corresponding section is not present. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process is then repeated looping through every available topic page, with all collected data for each topic page combined into a dataframe and appened to the overall dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two versions of this dataframe are then created: one deduplicated with respect to Publication Title and one grouped by Topic and deduplicated with respect to Publication Title, due to Figure 1 requiring the latter and Figure 2 requiring the former. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is then processed and presented as specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In Figure 2 LDOR values are jittered to aid visual interpretability. "
